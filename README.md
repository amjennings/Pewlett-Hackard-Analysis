# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis involved company data including the departments, managers, and employees, as well as information about how long they have been with the company. All of the relevant information was originally provided in six different CSV files. Relationships among the files were outlined and additional tables were created to complete the analysis. The purpose of this analysis was to identify which employees will be retiring soon, within specific departments. An additional analysis was conducted to identify specific employees who would be eligible for a mentorship program, in which experienced employees in the Sales and Development departments would stay on in a part-time role before retiring.

## **Results**
 
- The total number of employees eligible for retirement is 72,458.

## **Summary**
The number of roles that will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins will be a total of 72,458. This includes more than 20,000 Senior Engineers and 20,000 Senior Staff. 

The number of qualified, retirement-ready employees is not sufficient to mentor the next generation, as it only includes 1,549 employees. 

Additional queries that would be useful to conduct would be to evaluate the number of mentorship eligible employees by title. Given most retirees will be Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, this is the position that would benefit from more mentors.

Another query that would be helpful, would be to start analyzing employees eligible for mentorship in the next coming years. This way the company could begin talking to these employees to find out if they would even be interested or if they plan to just fully retire. The company may need to find additional mentors as not everyone may be interested in staying on part time.
